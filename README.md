# About

This is an application created by me for a Friend, who didn't want to learn the math behind calculating percentages when rolling dice, so I developed this application that generates random numbers and converts them into percentages for him. This works simulating the rolls according to the pattern gived by the user on the Inputs. As it is based on calculating percents by bruteforce, as more dice you roll at a time, more accurate will be the result and, of course, it's an approximation so it varies. I'm not sure about the math of all this, but the application coresponded to my friend's demands, so, Here we Are.

# Tecnologies
 Its Created Using React with Styled Components and the Module Random. I'm new to React so it worked as a study project for me and the code may be a little Messy.
