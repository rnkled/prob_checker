# About

This is an application created for a Friend who didn't want to learn the math behind calculating percentages when rolling dice, so I developed this to generates random numbers and converts them into percentages for him. This works simulating the rolls according to the pattern gived by the user on the Inputs. The process is based on calculating percents by bruteforce, so, as more dice you roll more accurate will be the result, and, of course, it's an approximation so it varies. I'm not sure about the math of all this, but the application coresponded to my friend's demands, so, Here we Are.

# Technologies
 Its Created Using React with Styled Components and the Module Random. I'm new to React so it worked as a study project for me and the code may be a little Messy.
