# About

This is an application created for a friend who didn't want to learn the math behind calculating percentages when rolling dice, so I developed this to generate random numbers and convert them into percentages for him. This works by simulating the rolls according to the pattern provided by the user in the inputs. The process is based on calculating percentages through brute force, so the more dice you roll, the more accurate the result will be. Of course, itâ€™s an approximation, so it varies. I'm not sure about the math behind all this, but the application met my friend's needs, so here we are.

# Technologies

It's created using React with Styled Components and the Random module. I'm new to React, so it served as a study project for me, and the code may be a little messy.

## Link

A live version hosted on Vercel can be found at: [https://app-do-maminha.vercel.app/](https://app-do-maminha.vercel.app/)

It was started with create-react-app, so "yarn start" runs the app in development mode, and "yarn build" is for production.
